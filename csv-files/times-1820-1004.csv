			HOUSE OF LORDST,) 'ThISDAY, OCT. 3.
			This day tbe house re-assembled, pursuant to adjournment. The peers began to take their plaocs soon after nine o'clock, and at about seven minutes betbre ten the Lord-Chpncellor entcr6d, and seated himself on the woolsack.
			Praycis were then rea(. and the house called over. Apologies were made for the non-attendance of several peers, in consequenme of intisposition, or other causcs. Among those absent were Lord Sh:f- field, the Bishop of Bangor, the Earl of Chichester,.and the Duke of Newcsmtle. Lords GCambicr, Harewoot, an l Hillmborough, did niot answer, on the call.
			SIGNOR MARIETTI.
			The Earl af LWVERPOOI, betore their lordships proceeded to thc business of thc day, wished to kav a' few words on a transaction which had been madc the subject of conversation previouisly to the adjournment. He alluded to what had passed respecting a letter written by MI. Mlarietti, of 1filan, to his soniin this country, with reference to the alicn bill. In consequence of what was stated in that letter, he had felt it to be his duty to write to Colonel Browne for an explanation of his conviuct. Having received his answer, he would, with their lordshiips' permission, lay on the table the corre- spondence which had passed on the subject,and fie wVas pe suaded that the explanation would be found perfectly satisfadtotv. [A Veer cx- pressed a wish to hear the corresoondeuice reaia.1 He hae1 no objection to state the contents of the papers. [ EIere the noble earl read several extracts, which were not distinctly heard throtighout.j Theiirat,as we understood it, was a letter from Colonel Browne, in which he referrel to a conversation he had had with i clirk of AL. llarfitti: He had written a letter to I; MIariettd,a copyv of which (No. ly he enclosed w'ith the origillst answer (No. 2). fle trusted that, whefl *iese-papers were examined, he would be founld fill-3' acquitted of the charge which had been -madcXAinst'Nm. Tt;had:been his *ish to fulfil the instructions he had ~received4 but lie 'hopedh'e shoUldt aneerDcL ineopLsistejit with1 justice. [Rg t csecWees; see -aoltuer martotonr c aisrf l
			The lE.arl of l.lVERPOOL, lhu.irig laid theletters orrtile table; 3ad not the slightest objection to their being printed, if such should ae the pleasure of the house. If any ftirthUr doubt shouldl be entcr- cained on tis suibject by any aF tlheit lotdsbips, it wpuld still be )pcn toinquirv. Itwas Colonel Browne's wish that it.slhould be probed to the botoim, and he was therefore miost desirous that the tullest explanaton should be given.
			LIord IOI,AMD thought it necessary to observe, that thouighi itshould be perfectly true that the alien bill had never been mention- cd by name to Al. illarietti,' that fact would be no answer to the
			encral objections which existed to thc'alienl bill on- account of its nature, and of thc effcet it might have on this inquiry. On the con- ntrvy, irat had passed servcYto confwrnm the apprdhenslons. enter- tianedi of its eect, for the correspondence showed that that bill was looked to with alarm. Hie must also declare that the statement wvhich the noble earl had rnade was not conviincing.to hi inindm; nor coul(i any cx-partc xtatement be convincing to their lordships. of Colonel Brewne lie knew nothing; but the noblelord had concluded withl expressing kis wilingniess to afford further exiplanations from that gentlemaLn, ii aby toubi shoutd renmain. For hMs owh vnart he inust say, that'in bis mtind no satisfactory explanation could be given ithhout a full investigation of all that had passed bv the ex- amination o.^the partics. Laying the papers on the table ivas not suf- ficient for this purpose. The alien act,'it was said, had not been mentioned but their iordships must be aware that it was very possiblc to convey to men's minids thc apprehension of ttle pe- nalty of that act without naiming it, and it could hot escapc their abservation thiat it was atdmitted thete thd l bedn zi donVersation be- tween a clerk and Colonel Browne relative to Al. .Ilatietti. If, therefore, it was wished that tbe suspicion should be effectually done tway, there inust be a farther investigation. lie would, therefore, reserve to himself the right of again calling their lordships' attention to this subject wvhen theprinted papers should beon the table.
			The Earl of LIVERP(Oli said a-vord or tvo which we did not hear.
			The tlarl of LAUDERDALE suggested, tbat,.bedoreany #fdthel piroceeding could with propriety take placc, it would be necessary (o ret the letter which i. Alarietti had written to his sn. That letter, he supposed, could be easXiily obtaine^d; and it appeared to hinm indis- pensable, if a foundation was to be laid for tuture investigation. Thils first step, he thought, wvouhl be but Justice to Colonel Browne, as *vell as to the tDarties in the present cAse. If, thierefore. ahv inqiliry was ihntdndedto le histlte, hdped mean: woald b taken tb obtahl that letter.

Whatever the amount niight be, he considird it as money ibisapplied, as *nuch worse than tliirow'ni a'ay. An account of the expendit&tre bad been or(lerel by: the

			The Marquis of LANSDOWN tiought that the obiection of the noble-earl would be sombivhat .nmre reasonable if h9.e had op- poset thce grantin of an account of the. cxpenses on thle other side; but that account having been granted he did not.sce an,y ground for refusifig the piek6ft (1 mand.

'In this situatioin, with alUthe time which their lordshipa harlafforded him for r.llection, it wasrdificult for hin to compose his mind to the proper discharge of his professional dut; for he was stil weighed down with tbe sense of the,.heavyyresponsib lity of the task he had undertaken. [le must also obuerve, that it was nolighit adiipn to the anx.iety of tbis feeling to foresee that, before thce'procecdings closed, it might be hiis unex- ampled lot to act in a wiy'which miglt appeir inconsistent with the dluty of a good sobject-to state what mlght makcc some call in qur - tion his loyalty, thouglh that was-not what heanticipited from-their lordsblps. He would now zernind their lordships th.t his illustrious client, thein Carolineof Branswick, arrived in ts country in the year 1795; she was the niece of the Sovereij,;, and the intended consort ot the heir-;ipparent, and was berself not far'emoved from the succession to the ,own, Bat he now went back to that period solely for the ojirpose bf passing over all that had elapsed from her arrival until her departure in 18144; and he rejoiced that the most faithful dis- charge of his duty permittel him to take this course. LBat he could not do this without paiusingforamtbment to vindicate liimself against an imputation to which he might not unnaturally be exposed in con- sequence of.the course which lie pursued, and to assure their lord- ship.s that the cause of the QCueen, as it appearCd in cvidence, did not require recrimination at present. The evidence against herBlajesty, he felt, did not now call pt)on him to utter one whisper against the conduct of her illustrious consort, and he soleninly assured their lordships that but for that conviction his lips would not at that tine he closed. In this di.icretionary exercise of' hii duty, in postponing the case whicb lie possessed, their lordships must know that he was waving a riglht which belonged to hirp, and abstaining from the use of m'arerials wvlinch were Qoqurtestionably his own. If, however, he, should hereafter thitk it advisable to exercise this right-_iflie slhould think it necessary-to avail hjinself of mieann which he at present de- clined using-let it not be vainly supposed that he,or even the young- cstlemiberftithe'B0ofes4iot,wo 1.hesitttefito retorttosych -a toWtrse, and fearlessly peroru his dutg.' le had before stated io theIr- lord- ships-but surcly of that it waa sear&el-y - liecessary to remmid thlem -that an advocate, in tbe discharge of his duty, knows but one per- soin in all the world, and that person is.his client. To save that client by all means 'and epcdieit, 'anid at all hazafds anrd
			costs to other persons, and, aniong theim, to himse)f, is his first and onl) duty; and in performing this duty-he must not regard the alarm, the torments, the destruction which he may bring upon.ethers. Separating the duty of a patriot from that of an advocate, he must go on reckless of consequences, thoughi it should be his unhappy fate to involve ,iscounitryin confusion. Hfe felt, however, that, were he now to enter on the branch of his cise to which he had alludeAl, he should seem to quit thc highier grounid of innocenice on which he wvas proud to stand. He ivould seem to seek to justify, not to resist thc charges, and plead not guilty- to acknowledge and extentare of- fences,. levities, and indiscreons, thie verv least of which hIe came therc to deny. For it was foul and fial5e tO say 35 se,me nt those wYho, under pretence e,f their *Itnty to Godt, forgot their duty to their fellow-creatures, had dared to sav, and they knew it to be false and foul when they asserted itthat any inmpro. ptoprieties were adinitted to havebeen proved againsb the Queen. He denied that any indiscretions were admitted. He contended not only that the evidence did not prove them, but that it disproved them. One admission he did malkc; and let thelearned counsel who supported the bill talie it, andl make the most thev could of it, for it was the only admission that would be made to ihem. He granted that ler Majesty had left this country for Italy ; he grantewl that while abroad -,he had mnoved in snciety chiefly foreign, in- terior probably to that wthich, under happier circumnstances, she had ktnown-and very diihrent, certainly, from that whicil she had pre- viously ecijoyed In this country. Iie admitted, that when the Qaeen was here, and happy, not, indleed, in the protection of her own fi- muilg', but in the frierls:ip of their lordships and their families, that she moved in more choice and dignified societv than any in which she hassince Sad the goot forttine to be placed. I'lie charge against her was-that she went to Italy, aid that, instead of associ- ating with the peeTs and peeresses of England, she took to her ssciety only foreigners. He fullv ad(nitted that her Majesty had been under the necessity of associatimg with Italian nobility, and sometimes with the comrrsonalty of that country. But *ho are they that bring this cluarFe ? Othiers might blame her Majesty fox going abroad-others might saylthat she lhad experienced the conse- quences of leaving this country and associating with foreigners; but it was not for their lordships to make this ciarge. They were the very last persons 'who should fling this at the Queen; for they who nowv presumed to sit as her judges were the very witnesses she must call to acquit lher of this charge. They were, in fact, rot only the wib,essss to acquit-but haid been the cause of this single ad-
			rtmtted tact. W*thile. herMlajesty resided in this country she courteously threw opcn. her doors to the peers of England and their families. She graciously condescended to court their society, and, as long as it suitel certain purposes which were not hers-as long as it served interests in which she hadl no concern-as long as she could be made subservient to the ambitious views of others- stc (lid not court its vain. But when a change took place-when those interests were to be retained wlihl she had been -made the in- strument of grasping-when that lust of power and place to which she was doomed to fall a victim lhad been sattisfied-then in vain did shc open her doors to their lorlships an(d their families ; then it was that those whom she hal hitherto condescended to court- and it- was no humiliation to -court the first society in the WOrTld- abaingoned her. l'tr Mtajesty vas then reduced to the alternative of begwiig society in this. country as a favour, or of leaving it. Slhe coui'd not, by humblinig herself, have obtained the society of British peeresses, ar.d muhst have sought that of other classes, or gone abroad. Sucb,then,beingr the CiretmstanlceS, it was not in the presence of their lordships that he expected to hear the Queen reproached for going nbroad, It was not here that he had thought any one would have dared to lift up his voice, and make it a topic of censure that the Princess of Wales had associated viith foreigners-with some whom,perhaps, she might say she would ndti and ought not have chosen un- der other and happier circumstanCes. tVp to this period her Ma- jesty had still one pleasure left. She enjoyed1 not indeed the so- ciety, but the affection and grateful respect of her beloved (laughter. An event, of all things most gratefil to a mother's feelings,soon atler took place -thc marriage of her beloved daughter. Ofthis event her MIajesty received no announcemnent. Though all England was lookirng Wwards the approaching event with the deep in- terest it was so well calculated to excite-thouIh all3 urope-was look- ing at it with the liveliest feelings, ind with all the knowledge of the intereAstiig event wvhich was about to takle place-still there was one person, and one only, lcft in ignorance of the whole proceeding, and that solitary indiridu,al was the mother of the bride. All that she had done up to that timd to deservn.,his treatment was, that she had been charged, and afterwards acquittcd,. of an alleged crime, and her perjured persecutors rendered infamous; and this treat. ment she received trom his Mlajesty's servants, some of whom had risen in power by having maade her a tool to promote their own interests; The Queen heard of the event of the approaching mar. riage of her only child accidentally; she heard it from a courier,
			who was going fiom itis country charged with a notification of it to his Holiness the Pope-zthat anclent, intimate, and much-valued ally of the Protestant Crown of England. The marfiage of her daughter took place; It xctited the sensations which it was so well calculated to produce, as tlle Promi,sed source of so nmuch hlappiness to the Royal Family and the nationi. The whole of that periodl passed withloult the slightest commlunication being made to the Qneen.'The pmeriod of' hePrincesaClharlotte's accoiuwl-ernewt arrived1her nothet wss the,n fearful of opening a commrunication upon the sub. ject, knowing the agisgti.on it might create in the mind of her beloved daughter.

			HOUSE OF LORDS, TUESDAY, OCT. 3.
			This day tbe house re-assembled, pursuant to adjournment. The peers began to take their places soon after nine o'clock, and at about seven minutes before ten the Lord-Chancellor entered, and seated himself on the woolsack.
			Prayers were then read, and the house called over. Apologies were made for the non-attendance of several peers, in consequence of intdisposition, or other causes. Among those absent were Lord Sheffield, the Bishop of Bangor, the Earl of Chichester, and the Duke of Newcastle. Lords Gambier, Harewood, and  Hillsborough, did not answer, on the call.
			SIGNOR MARIETTI.
			The Earl of LIVERPOOL, before their lordships proceeded to thc business of thc day, wished to say a few words on a transaction which had been madc the subject of conversation previouisly to the adjournment. He alluded to what had passed respecting a letter written by M. Marietti, of Milan, to his son in this country, with reference to the alien bill. In consequence of what was stated in that letter, he had felt it to be his duty to write to Colonel Browne for an explanation of his conduct. Having received his answer, he would, with their lordships' permission, lay on the table the corre-spondence which had passed on the subject,and he was persuaded that the explanation would be found perfectly satisfactory. [A peer expressed a wish to hear the correspondence read] He had no objection to state the contents of the papers. [ Here the noble earl read several extracts, which were not distinctly heard throguhout.j The first,as we understood it, was a letter from Colonel Browne, in which he referrel to a conversation he had had with a clerk of M.Marietti : He had written a letter to M.Marietti,a copy of which (No. 1)  he enclosed with the original answer (No. 2). He trusted that, when these-papers were examined, he would be found fully acquitted of the charge which had been made against him. It had:been his wish to fulfil the instructions he had received but he 'hoped he should never act inconsistent with justice. [For these letters, see another part of our paper.]
			The Earl of LlVERPOOL, having laid theletters on the table; had not the slightest objection to their being printed, if such should ae the pleasure of the house. If any further doubt shouldl be entertained on this subject by any of their lordships, it would still be  open to inquiry. It was Colonel Browne's wish that it should be probed to the bottom, and he was therefore most desirous that the fullest explanaton should be given.
			Lord Holland thought it necessary to observe, that thouighi its hould be perfectly true that the alien bill had never been mentioned by name to M. Marrietti,' that fact would be no answer to the general objections which existed to the alien bill on- account of its nature, and of thc effect it might have on this inquiry. On the contrary, what had passed served to confirm the apprehensions entertained of of its affect, for the correspondence showed that that bill was looked to with alarm. Hie must also declare that the statement wvhich the noble earl had rnade was not conviincing.to hi inindm; nor coul(i any cx-partc xtatement be convincing to their lordships. of Colonel Brewne lie knew nothing; but the noblelord had concluded withl expressing kis wilingniess to afford further exiplanations from that gentlemaLn, ii aby toubi shoutd renmain. For hMs owh vnart he inust say, that'in bis mtind no satisfactory explanation could be given ithhout a full investigation of all that had passed bv the ex- amination o.^the partics. Laying the papers on the table ivas not suf- ficient for this purpose. The alien act,'it was said, had not been mentioned but their iordships must be aware that it was very possiblc to convey to men's minids thc apprehension of ttle pe- nalty of that act without naiming it, and it could hot escapc their abservation thiat it was atdmitted thete thd l bedn zi donVersation be- tween a clerk and Colonel Browne relative to Al. .Ilatietti. If, therefore, it was wished that tbe suspicion should be effectually done tway, there inust be a farther investigation. lie would, therefore, reserve to himself the right of again calling their lordships' attention to this subject wvhen theprinted papers should beon the table.
			The Earl of LIVERPOOL said a word or two which we did not hear.
			The tlarl of LAUDERDALE suggested, tbat,.bedoreany #fdthel piroceeding could with propriety take placc, it would be necessary (o ret the letter which i. Alarietti had written to his sn. That letter, he supposed, could be easXiily obtaine^d; and it appeared to hinm indis- pensable, if a foundation was to be laid for tuture investigation. Thils first step, he thought, wvouhl be but Justice to Colonel Browne, as *vell as to the tDarties in the present cAse. If, thierefore. ahv inqiliry was ihntdndedto le histlte, hdped mean: woald b taken tb obtahl that letter.

'In this situatioin, with alUthe time which their lordshipa harlafforded him for r.llection, it wasrdificult for hin to compose his mind to the proper discharge of his professional dut; for he was stil weighed down with tbe sense of the,.heavyyresponsib lity of the task he had undertaken. [le must also obuerve, that it was nolighit adiipn to the anx.iety of tbis feeling to foresee that, before thce'procecdings closed, it might be hiis unex- ampled lot to act in a wiy'which miglt appeir inconsistent with the dluty of a good sobject-to state what mlght makcc some call in qur - tion his loyalty, thouglh that was-not what heanticipited from-their lordsblps. He would now zernind their lordships th.t his illustrious client, thein Carolineof Branswick, arrived in ts country in the year 1795; she was the niece of the Sovereij,;, and the intended consort ot the heir-;ipparent, and was berself not far'emoved from the succession to the ,own, Bat he now went back to that period solely for the ojirpose bf passing over all that had elapsed from her arrival until her departure in 18144; and he rejoiced that the most faithful dis- charge of his duty permittel him to take this course. LBat he could not do this without paiusingforamtbment to vindicate liimself against an imputation to which he might not unnaturally be exposed in con- sequence of.the course which lie pursued, and to assure their lord- ship.s that the cause of the QCueen, as it appearCd in cvidence, did not require recrimination at present. The evidence against herBlajesty, he felt, did not now call pt)on him to utter one whisper against the conduct of her illustrious consort, and he soleninly assured their lordships that but for that conviction his lips would not at that tine he closed. In this di.icretionary exercise of' hii duty, in postponing the case whicb lie possessed, their lordships must know that he was waving a riglht which belonged to hirp, and abstaining from the use of m'arerials wvlinch were Qoqurtestionably his own. If, however, he, should hereafter thitk it advisable to exercise this right-_iflie slhould think it necessary-to avail hjinself of mieann which he at present de- clined using-let it not be vainly supposed that he,or even the young- cstlemiberftithe'B0ofes4iot,wo 1.hesitttefito retorttosych -a toWtrse, and fearlessly peroru his dutg.' le had before stated io theIr- lord- ships-but surcly of that it waa sear&el-y - liecessary to remmid thlem -that an advocate, in tbe discharge of his duty, knows but one per- soin in all the world, and that person is.his client. To save that client by all means 'and epcdieit, 'anid at all hazafds anrd
			costs to other persons, and, aniong theim, to himse)f, is his first and onl) duty; and in performing this duty-he must not regard the alarm, the torments, the destruction which he may bring upon.ethers. Separating the duty of a patriot from that of an advocate, he must go on reckless of consequences, thoughi it should be his unhappy fate to involve ,iscounitryin confusion. Hfe felt, however, that, were he now to enter on the branch of his cise to which he had alludeAl, he should seem to quit thc highier grounid of innocenice on which he wvas proud to stand. He ivould seem to seek to justify, not to resist thc charges, and plead not guilty- to acknowledge and extentare of- fences,. levities, and indiscreons, thie verv least of which hIe came therc to deny. For it was foul and fial5e tO say 35 se,me nt those wYho, under pretence e,f their *Itnty to Godt, forgot their duty to their fellow-creatures, had dared to sav, and they knew it to be false and foul when they asserted itthat any inmpro. ptoprieties were adinitted to havebeen proved againsb the Queen. He denied that any indiscretions were admitted. He contended not only that the evidence did not prove them, but that it disproved them. One admission he did malkc; and let thelearned counsel who supported the bill talie it, andl make the most thev could of it, for it was the only admission that would be made to ihem. He granted that ler Majesty had left this country for Italy ; he grantewl that while abroad -,he had mnoved in snciety chiefly foreign, in- terior probably to that wthich, under happier circumnstances, she had ktnown-and very diihrent, certainly, from that whicil she had pre- viously ecijoyed In this country. Iie admitted, that when the Qaeen was here, and happy, not, indleed, in the protection of her own fi- muilg', but in the frierls:ip of their lordships and their families, that she moved in more choice and dignified societv than any in which she hassince Sad the goot forttine to be placed. I'lie charge against her was-that she went to Italy, aid that, instead of associ- ating with the peeTs and peeresses of England, she took to her ssciety only foreigners. He fullv ad(nitted that her Majesty had been under the necessity of associatimg with Italian nobility, and sometimes with the comrrsonalty of that country. But *ho are they that bring this cluarFe ? Othiers might blame her Majesty fox going abroad-others might saylthat she lhad experienced the conse- quences of leaving this country and associating with foreigners; but it was not for their lordships to make this ciarge. They were the very last persons 'who should fling this at the Queen; for they who nowv presumed to sit as her judges were the very witnesses she must call to acquit lher of this charge. They were, in fact, rot only the wib,essss to acquit-but haid been the cause of this single ad-
			rtmtted tact. W*thile. herMlajesty resided in this country she courteously threw opcn. her doors to the peers of England and their families. She graciously condescended to court their society, and, as long as it suitel certain purposes which were not hers-as long as it served interests in which she hadl no concern-as long as she could be made subservient to the ambitious views of others- stc (lid not court its vain. But when a change took place-when those interests were to be retained wlihl she had been -made the in- strument of grasping-when that lust of power and place to which she was doomed to fall a victim lhad been sattisfied-then in vain did shc open her doors to their lorlships an(d their families ; then it was that those whom she hal hitherto condescended to court- and it- was no humiliation to -court the first society in the WOrTld- abaingoned her. l'tr Mtajesty vas then reduced to the alternative of begwiig society in this. country as a favour, or of leaving it. Slhe coui'd not, by humblinig herself, have obtained the society of British peeresses, ar.d muhst have sought that of other classes, or gone abroad. Sucb,then,beingr the CiretmstanlceS, it was not in the presence of their lordships that he expected to hear the Queen reproached for going nbroad, It was not here that he had thought any one would have dared to lift up his voice, and make it a topic of censure that the Princess of Wales had associated viith foreigners-with some whom,perhaps, she might say she would ndti and ought not have chosen un- der other and happier circumstanCes. tVp to this period her Ma- jesty had still one pleasure left. She enjoyed1 not indeed the so- ciety, but the affection and grateful respect of her beloved (laughter. An event, of all things most gratefil to a mother's feelings,soon atler took place -thc marriage of her beloved daughter. Ofthis event her MIajesty received no announcemnent. Though all England was lookirng Wwards the approaching event with the deep in- terest it was so well calculated to excite-thouIh all3 urope-was look- ing at it with the liveliest feelings, ind with all the knowledge of the intereAstiig event wvhich was about to takle place-still there was one person, and one only, lcft in ignorance of the whole proceeding, and that solitary indiridu,al was the mother of the bride. All that she had done up to that timd to deservn.,his treatment was, that she had been charged, and afterwards acquittcd,. of an alleged crime, and her perjured persecutors rendered infamous; and this treat. ment she received trom his Mlajesty's servants, some of whom had risen in power by having maade her a tool to promote their own interests; The Queen heard of the event of the approaching mar. riage of her only child accidentally; she heard it from a courier,
			who was going fiom itis country charged with a notification of it to his Holiness the Pope-zthat anclent, intimate, and much-valued ally of the Protestant Crown of England. The marfiage of her daughter took place; It xctited the sensations which it was so well calculated to produce, as tlle Promi,sed source of so nmuch hlappiness to the Royal Family and the nationi. The whole of that periodl passed withloult the slightest commlunication being made to the Qneen.'The pmeriod of' hePrincesaClharlotte's accoiuwl-ernewt arrived1her nothet wss the,n fearful of opening a commrunication upon the sub. ject, knowing the agisgti.on it might create in the mind of her beloved daughter. She knewv at such' a nlorttent the perilous results that might follow to the beloved object of he' riatetual solicitude, were sle at that period to create any agitation in hef ntind upon a topic, whicli might expose her fo a quarrel with power t-d authority on the one hand; or combat her peace and affection on the athfr. An event followved' itlieh destroyed for ever the hopes of the countrv-n event whici filled all hniland with grief and sorrow, and wvith a. mourrning in wvhich all their fot'eignr neiglhboturs unaffectedly synipa- ltized.

But if suspicions -were excited then, how were they -confirmied on the fol- lowing norring?

			Milan, Sept. 19.
			Most worthy Colonel,_I understood, with great concern, that your namehas been compromised in a subject of conversation, which was supposed to have taken place between you and me rela-| tive to my son Joseph, at present in London. I think it there- fore a duty to declare, as I now declare upon my honour, that no conversation ever passed between you and me, directly on this subject. If thie expressions contained in a letter written by me to my son are somewhat strong, that must be ascribed to the affection wvhich a lively interest in him created, and a conformity to the advice I have alwaYs given him-advice tending to manifest the necessity of adhering to the system adopted by me, never to mix in affairs fo- reign to one's own basiness. It grieves me exceedingly that an in- terpretation has been given to my letter opposite to my irtentions-
			an interpretation which sutpplies materials to discussions irrelevant and ill founded. .Uy displeasure in this case increases at seeing that a similar interpretation has caused doubts regarding the good faith of an individual whose distinguislhed and honourable character is known to me by long experience.
			I consider you, moreover, incapable of making use of the threats which are attributed to you, as the British government is of exe- cuting them. In taking this mode of stating tp you the sentiments Witli which I amanimated in the present emergency, I experience thesweet satisfaction of fulfilling a duty which is incumbent upon me, and I take the opportunity of assuring you of my perfect esteem. -

			LETTER TROX 311L ALBERTONIO TO COLONEL EROWN.
			Atilan, Sep. 19.
			dl. Colonel,-It is with regret proportioned to the respect which I bear you that I learn that the sense of a letter written by Al. larietti to lhis son, has been so ill understood as to have imputed to you the communication of anA intention on the part of the British Government to watch over the latter, and to send him out of England on account of his relations with2 Sac- chini, a witness in the case of the Queen. I remember that you said to me, one morning that I was present withi you on busi- ness, that you had received a letter from England, stating the inter- ference of Joseph Marietti itl this affair, and that you could not but regard such conduct as a little unwise, and foreign to his occupation in London. I cannot at the same titne forget that I regarded this communication as a simple opinion emanating from yourself,and very far from the expression of authority or of menace. As regards wvhat is said on the Alien Bill, of the peovisions of which I am ignorant, itis adatyI owe to your character, always frank aind loyal in all re- spects, to say that you never gave ine the least reason to fear for the personal security or the protection of the said Joseph Marietti.
			I Can ade that I thought it my duty to beg dl. dIarietti the father, to write to his son to advise himi not to mix in an affair so foreign from his occupations, hut to restrict himself to the wise and moderate conduct which has always distinguished him; and if in wvriting to him his father has made use of strong expressions, they ought in no wise to be ascribed to you, Colorel Brown, but solely to the confidence and paternal afrection which dictated them.

			1\ilan, Sept. 2Q.
			Dearest Son,-Iani ever the more confirmed in my maxim that it is riglt to have as little as possible to do with the great. I must say that the government in question has too strictly inter- preted the letter I wrote you, and which has presented to the minister of police other motives than those which really origi- nated it, since it is right to tell you that the English government has written an angry letter to Colonel Brown. He (Colonel Brown), feeling h.mself much disquieted on this account, made such an ap- plication to Sig. D. Ciceri, and to Sig. Albertonio, that the farmer begged me to convey to the said Colonel Brown a letter of mine, which in a certain way( in ccrto qual inodo),might justify him with his government from the tog rigorous interpretation given to mny former letter. And after having written and re-vritten, through the mc- diu,p of the said Signor Ciceri, draughts of such a letter to be shown, tihe opy which I enclose to your address wasfixed upon. You will like- wise jind the copy of a letter which the said Col. Brown desired from the saigSignor-Albertonio,who gave me the accoant conta-ned in the letters formerly addressed to you. To the honour of truth I have re- garded whbatCol.Brown said through the medium ofSigaorAlbertonio as an act of friendship,topreventhim from being brought into any dan- ger.Nor could I ever have imagined that suclia thing could havebeen of as much importance as it has proved. However that be, to facilitate the allaying of such a controversy, and to preserve amity with all, I have thought proper to second it, as you will perceive by the copy. They wislhed me to declare that my firstletter was the result of my own simple suspicion, and bad no giound to rest upon; lout this I would not allow, because the having-named Colonel Brown in the way I did would have been charged on me as a calumnious imputa- tion; and therefore yoe will see in my letter sent yesterday to him (Col. Brown) that I mention my not having direct conversation with him, and derive my information from what he caused to besaid to me by Sig. Albertonio. Regulate yourself therefore in every thing with the greatest prudence, in order not to incur other annoyances and other dissatisfactions, which can only produce evil to you.

But the conclusion is to keep every thing silent, and to prevent all publicity. I salute you, your affectionate Father. No. 2. LETTER FROM MR. MARIETTI THE ELDER, TO COL. BROWN Milan, Sept. 19. Most worthy Colonel, - I understood, with great concern, that your name has been compromised in a subject of conversation, which was supposed to have taken place between you and me relative to my son Joseph, at present in London. I think it therefore a duty to declare, as I now declare upon my honor, that no conversation ever passed between you and me, directly on this subject. If the expressions contained in a letter written by me to my son are somewhat strong, that must be ascribed to the affection which a lively interest in him created, and a conformity to the advice I have always given him - advice tending to manifest the necessity of adhering to the system adopted by me, never to mix in affairs foreign to one's own business. It grieves me exceedingly that an interpretation which supplies materials to discussions irrelevant and ill founded. My displeasure in this case increases at seeing that a similar interpretation has caused doubts regarding the good faith of an individual whose distinguished and honourable character is known to me by long experience. I consider you, moreover, incapable of making use of the threats which are attributed to you, as the British government is of executing them. In taking this mode of stating to you the sentiments with which I am animated in the present emergency, I experience the sweet satisfaction of fulfilling a duty which is incumbent upon me, and I take the opportunity of assuring you of my perfect esteem. No. 3. LETTER FROM MR. ALBERTONIO TO COLONEL BROWN. Milan, Sep. 19. M. Colonel, - It is with regret proportioned to the respect which I bear you that I learn that the sense of a letter written by M. Marietti to his son, has been so ill understood as to have imputed to you the communication of an intention on the part of the British Government to watch over the latter, and to send him out of England on account of his relations with Sacchini, a witness in the case of the Queen. I remember that you said to me, one morning that I was present with you on business, that you had received a letter from England, stating the interference of Joseph Marietti in this affair, and that you could not but regard such conduct as a little unwise, and foreign to his occupation in London. I cannot at the same time foeget that I regarded this communication as a simple opinion emanating from yourself, and very far from the expression of authority or of menace. As regards what is said on the Alien Bill, of the provisions of which I am ignorant, it is a duty I owe to your character, always frank and loyal in all respects, to say that you never gave me the least reason to fear for the personal security or the protection of the said Joseph Marietti. I can add that I thought it my duty to beg M. Marietti the father, to write to his son to advise him not to mix in an affair so foreign from his occupations, but to restrict himself to the wise and moderate conduct which has always distinguished him; and if in writing to him his father has made use of strong expressions, they ought in no wise to be ascribed to you, Colonel Brown, but solely to the confidence and paternal affection which dictated them. No. 4. LETTER FROM MR. MARIETTI THE ELDER TO HIS SON IN LONDON, (NOT READ YESTERDAY BY LORD LIVERPOOL IN PARLIAMENT.) Milan, Sept. 20. Dearest Son, - I am ever the more confirmed in my maxim that it is right to have as little as possible to do with the great. I must say that the government in question has too strictly interpreted the letter I wrote you, and which has presented to the minister of police other motives than those which really originated it, since it is right to tell you that the English government has written an angry letter to Colonel Brown. He (Colonel Brown), feeling himself much disquieted on this account, made such an application to Sig. D. Ciceri, and to Sig. Albertonio, that the former begged me to convey to the said Colonel Brown a letter of mine, which in a certain way (in certo qual modo), might justify him with his government from the too rigorous interpretation given to my former letter. And after having written and re-written, through the medium of the said Signor Ciceri, draughts of such a letter to be shown, the copy which I enclose to your address was fixed upon. You will likewise find the copy of a letter which the said Col. Brown desired from the said Signor Albertonio, who gave me the account contained in the letters formerly addressed to you. To the honour of truth I have regarded what Col. Brown said through the medium of Signor Albertonio as an act of friendship, to prevent him from being brought into any danger. Nor could I ever have imagined that such a thing could have been of as much importance as it has proved. However that be, to faciliate the allaying of such a controversy, and to preserve amity with all, I have thought proper to second it, as you will perceive by the copy. They wished me to declare that my first letter was the result of my own simple suspicion, and had no ground to rest upon; but this I would not allow, because the having named Colonel Brown in the way I did would have been charged on me as a calumnious imputation; and therefore you will see in my letter sent yesterday to him (Col. Brown) that I mention my not having direct conversation with him, and derive my information from what he caused to be said to me by Sig. Albertonio. Regulate yourself therefore in every thing with the greatest prudence, in order not to incur other annoyances and other dissatisfactions, which can only produce evil to you. Your affectionate Father.",0FFO-1820-OCT04_Issue.xml
"Addresses Of The Lighter Men And Watermen, And Of The Parish Of St. Saviour, Southwark.",News,"ADDRrSSES OF TIHE LIGHTER MEN AND WA TER- MEN, AND OF TIHE PARISH OF ST. SAVIOUR, SOUTHWARX.
			It having been announced, that at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the Addresses to be presented to her Mlajesty, from the Lightermen and Watermen, and from the Churchwardens, Overseers, and Kothers, Inhabitants of St. Saviour, Southwark, were appointed to be carriet Pup to the Queenr immense numbers of persons assembled at a very early hour, at the Sonthwark bridge-stairs. The number of the boats, whichlit was absolutely impossible to' estimate; their general appearance and decorations, more especially the assemblage of beautiful females who were in waiting to celebrate and to enliven by their presence the affectioinate homage of such large and respect- able classes of thecommunity; the unusual fineness of the weather at thisperiod of theyear, and the entbusiastical expressionof,public feeling' whlich was exultingly mnanifcstcd upon every side, all com- bined to refider tiie scene at opee vast, joyous, anid magnificent. The great object of general attentiori were the.steam yachts, and or,c of Lthe City barges (we beficvdthi6 Fishrnongers') which conveyed the members of thc two deputations. These were extremely crowded,and
			wellfurnishe withlbands ofmusic. Ataboutaquarterpastl1 o'clock [the signal-gun was fired, ant] these yachts getting under weigh, many individuals; who possessed tid.ets were necessarily left behind, owing to the extraordinary denseness of the crowd trhich lined the quays and stairs upon either side of the river. On nooecasion whatever_not even upon that ralaiucholy one of the funeral of the immortal Nelson_was such a prodigious conceurse ever witnessed upon the Thames. Age and manhood-youth and infancy-the feeble and the strong; every description, every class of society, were collected in one immense mass, occupying the whole of the banks of the river, from Southawark and the opposite shore, to Branden- burgh..house. If the multitude was of a motley description, the same character was eminently applicable to the prodigious fleet of boats of every possible denomination, vhich, by its magnitude and diversity, gave life, spirit, and beauty to the moving picture which was presented to the eye. The barge whieh contained the deputation charged with the Address of the Watermnen andl Ligh-termen was distinguishled by the large and glowing ensign that bhe bore, the sailor.like and orderly appearance of her crew, and the respectability of her passengers. The several steamn-vachts, on board of which -were the dleputations from St. Saviour's, were en. ti.ely filled with gentlemen, the most opulent and of the highest cotl- sideration in that populousandwealthy parish, which contains nearly 19,000 inhabitants. The bridges presented an aspect truly singular; it was absolutely difficult to discern the smallest aspearance of Para.
			ueP un any or tnem, so entirejy were they occupied by innumerable spectators, who testified their sympathyand enthusiasm by reiterated shoats,which were re-echoed from the boatsand from theneighbour- ing shores, scarcely less thronged than tley. Wherever a vacant space presented ""standing room,"" as it is well termed, it may safely be said such vacant spaces, whether causeways, -public qunys, or private property, were entirely occupied by groups ef well.dressed persons, from Southwark to Vauxhall bridge. 2Weanvhile, the im- mense collection of boats ana pinr.aces of everysize and evcry deno- r ination-their crewn and compunies animated byonesteadfitst pur- pose and one general feeling-to al alppemance as unalloyed and tunmixed in their niature as they were universzl in their influence-pursued their course to Hamnernmitlt. The spec- tacle was splendid and imposing, Ibeyond anything of which mere description can convey an idea.-t 'twa an assemblage continually increasing, every creek and landing.place sent out fresh numbers to swell tlte augmenting procession. If any thting could add to the picturesque activity and variety which were manifested on the river, it was the beautiful display we observed upon WVandsworth-conmn,n Battersea, and Putney bridges, and other piaces, where pedestrians and equestriams were mingled together in friendly and not unpleasing disorder. But the concludingscene was also the most beautiful: the lawn beibre, and the grounds in the vicinity of Brandenburgh.houae, were thronged beyond expression: all that theinconvenience of heatand pressure could inflictupon those who were stationed there, were evidentlymore than compensated by the full enjoyment of thoe fveIings unde which they had ventured to undergo that inconvenience. The -alace
			I I
			was only accessible over what might be termed a bridge of boats; such wus the closeness and density of -the position in which they were accidentally placed. It was not without severe exertion and struggle, and after the lapse of a considerable time, that the de- putation with the Southxark aidress could-approach near to her Ma- jesty's residence. Her Mlajesry showed herself severel times in the balcony of the prindpal window, and was hailed with the warmest and most enthusiastic greetings. The deputation being at length admitted, her 'Majesty, preceded by Mr. Aldennan Woo, accom- panied by Lady A. Hamilton, and fol7owed bySir WV. (tel1, Lient. Hownam, Mr. Calvert, MI.P., and others, entered thc chamkr ia which sheis accustomedto receiveaddzeases. She wasnagniB'cently attired in a robe of muslin, richly einbroidered Pith silver: upon her head she wore a superb diamond aigrette; arnd displayed about her person several valuable je-wels. The mover of the addre,s abi the seconder, followed by the gentlemen of the deptonj were then directed to approach, and the former read the following address in a distinct and impressive manner :_

It having been announced, that at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the Addresses to be presented to her Majesty, from the Lightermen and Watermen, and from the Churchwardens, Overseers, and others, Inhabitants of St. Saviour, Southwark, were appointed to be carried up to the Queen, immense numbers of persons assembled at a very early hour, at the Southwark bridge-stairs. The number of the boats, which it was absolutely impossible to estimate; their general appearance and decorations, more especially the assemblage of beautiful females who were in waiting to celebrate and to enliven by their presence the affectionate homage of such large and respectable classes of the community; the unusual fineness of the weather at this period of the year, and the enthusiastical expression of public feeling which was exultingly manifested upon every side, all combined to render the scene at once vast, joyous, and magnificent. The great object of general attention were the steam yachts, and one of the City barges (we believe the Fishmongers) which conveyed the members of the two deputations. These were extremely crowded, and well furnished with bands of music. At about a quarter past 10 o'clock the signal-gun was fired, and these yachts getting under weigh, many individuals who possessed tickets were necessarily left behind, owing to the extraordinary denseness of the crowd which lined the quays and stairs upon either side of the river. On no occasion whatever - not even upon that melancholy one of the funeral of the immortal Nelson - was such a prodigious concourse ever witnessed upon the Thames. Age and manhood - youth and infancy - the feeble and the strong; every description, every class of society, were collected in one immense mass, occupying the whole of the banks of the river, from Southwark and the opposite shore, to Brandenburgh-house.

The several steam-yachts, on board of which were the deputations from St. Saviour's, were entirely filled with gentlemen, the most opulent and of the highest consideration in that populous and wealthy parish, which contains nearly 19,000 inhabitants. The bridges presented an aspect truly singular; it was absolutely difficult to discern the smallest appearance of parapet on any of them, so entirely were they occupied by innumerable spectators, who testified their sympathy and enthusiasm by reiterated shouts, which were re-echoed from the boats and from the neighbouring shores, scarcely less thronged than they. Wherever a vacant space presented ""standing room,"" as it is well termed, it may safely be said such vacant spaces, whether causeways, public quays, or private property, were entirely occupied by groups of well-dressed persons, from Southwark to Vauxhall bridge. Meanwhile, the immense collection of boats and pinnaces of every size and every denomination - their crews and companies animated by one steadfast purpose and one general feeling - to all appearance as unalloyed and unmixed in their nature as they were universal in their influence - pursued their course to Hammersmith. The spectacle was splendid and imposing, beyond anything of which mere description can convey an idea. It was an assemblage continually increasing, every creek and landing-place sent out fresh numbers to swell the augmenting procession. If any thing could add to the picturesque activity and variety which were manifested on the river, it was the beautiful display we observed upon Wandsworth-common, Battersea, and Putney bridges, and other places, where pedestrians and equestrians were mingled together in friendly and not unpleasing disorder. But the concluding scene was also the most beautiful: the lawn before, and the grounds in the vicinity of Brandenburgh-house, were thronged beyond expression: all that the inconvenience of heat and pressure could inflict upon those who were stationed there, were evidently more than compensated by the full enjoyment of those feelings unde which they had ventured to undergo that inconvenience. The place was only accessible over what might be termed a bridge of boats; such was the closeness and density of the position in which they were accidentally placed. It was not without severe exertion and struggle, and after the lapse of a considerable time, that the deputation with the Southwark address could approach near to her Majesty's residence. Her Majesty showed herself several times in the balcony of the principal window, and was hailed with the warmest and most enthusiastic greetings. The deputation being at length admitted, her Majesty, preceded by Mr. Alderman Wood, accompanied by Lady A. Hamilton, and followed by Sir W. Gell, Lieut. Hownam, Mr. Calvert, M.P., and others, entered the chamber in which she is accustomed to receive addresses. She was magnificently attired in a robe of muslin, richly embroidered with silver: upon her head she wore a superb diamond aigrette; and displayed about her person several valuable jewels. The mover of the addresses and the seconder, followed by the gentlemen of the deputation, were then directed to approach, and the former read the following address in a distinct and impressive manner: - ""To Her Most Gracious Majesty, Caroline Amelia Elizabeth, Consort of His Majesty King George the Fourth. ""May it please your Majesty, ""We, the Churchwardens, Overseers, and others, dutiful and loyal inhabitants of the parish of St. Saviour, in the Borough of Southwark, most humbly beg leave to approach your Majesty with our loyal congratulations on your Majesty's accession to the throne of these kingdoms, as Queen Consort of George the Fourth.

We therefore beg to assure your Majesty that there is not, in any portion of his Majesty's subjects, a people more sincerely disgusted with the vile slanders sent forth against your Majesty's character and honour, nor more inimical to the proceedings now pending in parliament to deprive your Majesty of your legal rights and privileges. We can never too much deplore the seizure of the first moment of his late Majesty's demise to erase your Majesty's name from the formula of our holy religion: thereby holding you up to the world as unworthy to receive the prayers of a pious people, notwithstanding that it is alleged the conduct which your Majesty is so basely charged with was known for a year preceding. Neither can we too much admire your firmness and wisdom in refusing the bribe so shamefully offered to you at St. Omer's, whereby your Majesty was insidiously invited to follow an alleged impious life; or your courage in treating with contempt the accompanying threat of bringing your Majesty to trial, if you did not remain abroad; thus giving to your admiring people a presumptive proof of your innocence, and by that very step proving that your Majesty is entitled to the attachment and loyalty of your affectionate people. The Bill of Pains and Penalties we deprecate on your Majesty's account particularly, as not being the legal mode whereby the charges alleged against your Majesty should be investigated; but we deprecate it also as a dangerous precedent, whereby a base ministry, assisted by a corrupt parliament, may at any future period depose a sovereign upon alleged charges of licentiousness and immorality, if they should have the means of hiring spies and of paying informers and foreign witnesses to swear to evidence that may appear to support such charges. But, Madam, it is with pride we congratulate your Majesty, that in your cause a British people are uncontaminated with the odium of forming any part of the criminatory witnesses against your Majesty. We feel great gratification that the foreign evidence produced against your Majesty has been of a description to defeat itself; and we trust that your Majesty has yet many happy years in store, to compensate you for the severe trials you have undergone; and we beg to assure your Majesty that the parish of St. Saviour, Southwark, will at all times be ready to contribute by every means in its power to show its duty, loyalty, and affectionate attachment."" This address was signed by more than 800 inhahitant householders, and her Majesty made to it the following most gracious reply, which was read by Mr. Alderman Wood: - ""I feel peculiar satisfaction in receiving this loyal and affectionate address from the Churchwardens, Overseers, and other Inhabitants of the Parish of St. Saviour, in the Borough of Southwark. ""Though I have no regard for any interest that is separated from the public welfare, and consequently disdain all connexion with any faction, yet it has been said that faction has marked me for its own. It might have been affirmed with much more truth, that persecution has marked me for its own. Persecution has harassed me with every species of malevolent vexation and of inquialtorial torture for near a quarter of a century. If my honour and my life have been preserved amidst so many perils as those to which I have been exposed from spies, traitors, and perfidious emissaries of every description, the cause must be ascribed, not to the defect of vigilance, or to any relaxion of effort in my enemies, but to the inherent strength of integrity, and to the invisible protection of the Almighty.

About the same time my name was omitted in the Liturgy, and I was held up to the country as an object of abomination for fictitious crimes. ""It is gratifying to me, and it is a proud reflection to the country, that of all the numerous witnesses who have deposed any thing prejudicial to my character, not one has been an Englishman. When, in the history of these proceedings, the character of the country is hereafter the object of impartial scrutiny, this circumstance will form a bright incident in the annals of England.

MARIA GLENN. This was an indictment for perjury. The name of the defendant has already in so many shapes appeared before the public, that a very brief sketch of the circumstances will suffice to recall the case to the recollection of our readers. At the Summer Assizes for the county of Dorset, in the year 1817, James Bowditch and others were tried for forcibly carrying off from her uncle, Mr. Tuckett, Maria Glenn, a young lady of some fortune, and of extremely tender age. The defence set up was, that the lady voluntarily eloped, and an infinite number of circumstances were sworn to which tended to show a previous familiar intercourse between the parties. The defendants were, however, principally upon the evidence of Miss Glenn herself, found guilty. In the ensuing term application for a new trial was made to the Court of King's Bench; and, upon the affidavits of William Turl, Ann Sutton, Frances Sutton, Elizabeth Sutton, and other persons, swearing to their positive knowledge of such acts of familiarity on the part of Miss Glenn towards James Bowditch as negatived all probability of a forcible abduction, a rule to show cause was granted. On the argument for making the rule absolute, Miss Glenn, by her affidavits, absolutely denied the statements contained in the affidavits against her; and the rule being in consequence discharged, the defendants were brought up for judgement, and sentenced to different terms of imprisonment. Upon the affidavits made by Miss Glenn against the rule for a new trial the present indictment was founded; and perjury was assigned upon upwards of forty statements. The assignments, however, upon which the case turned were three in number. First, upon Miss Glenn's statement - that she did not stand as godmother at the christening of Mrs. Mulraine's child; nor wore upon that occasion a spencer and bonnet belonging to Susannah Bowditch, the sister of James Bowditch; secondly, that she did not dance at a certain festival on the same evening at the house of Mrs. Joan Bowditch; and that she was not upon that occasion kissed as one of the godmothers; thirdly, that she never walked in the streets of Taunton, nor in a certain place called the French Weir-field, with James Bowditch. Mr. Scarlett, having very temperately stated the case, proceeded to call his witnesses; their evidence, however, was little else than a repetition of that which they had given on the preceding day, in the case of Miss Glenn's servant, Mary Whitby. Mary Priest swore to the presence of Miss Glenn at the christening of Mrs. Mulraine's child; to her standing godmother; and to her being dressed in the bonnet and spencer of Susannah Bowditch. William Turl, a music-master, swore to Miss Glenn's having danced at the christening festival, in the house of Mrs. Bowditch; to her having played upon the harp, accompanied by him (witness) upon the pianoforte; and to her having been kissed by him and by Wm. Bowditch, as one of the godmothers of the child. Ann Turl, the wife of the last witness, corroborated the evidence of her husband; and swore to a declaration on the part of Miss Glenn, that she had stood godmother to the child. Charles Puddy, a farmer, was present at the festival; saw Miss Glenn dance, and saw her kissed. Frances Sutton corroborated the evidence of Ann Turl. Sarah Bowditch swore that Miss Glenn went to the christening in the bonnet and spencer of her sister, Susannah Bowditch; and to her dancing and being kissed in the evening. Susannah Gibbons (formerly Sussannah Bowditch) swore to lending Miss Glenn her clothes. Elizabeth Mulraine swore that Miss Glenn stood godmother to her child, and that she went to church dressed in a bonnet and spencer belonging to Susannah Bowditch, and in a frock belonging to her, Mrs. Mulraine. She also swore to the dancing and kissing in the evening. Mrs. B Alcock, the wife of Colonel Alcock, of Taunton, deposed to seeing Miss Glenn meet and walk with James Bowditch, in the road before her house, a short time previous to the elopement. Miss Emma Alcock and Miss Harriet Alcock deposed to their having seen Miss Glenn upon four different occasions walk with James Bowditch in the French Weir-field. They knew the person of Miss Glenn perfectly well, and were confident that they had not been mistaken. The case being closed on the part of the prosecution, Mr. Sergeant PELL, the defendant's counsel, professed himself unable to address the jury with any prospect of success. The LORD CHIEF-JUSTICE then briefly went through the evidence, and the Jury, without deliberation, found a verdict of Guilty.",0FFO-1820-OCT04_Issue.xml
