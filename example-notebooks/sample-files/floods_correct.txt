THE FLOODS AND THE RAILWAYS. - The floods that during the last fortnight have been so unprecedented, particularly in the eastern and north-eastern districts, have put to a severer test than usual the strength and solidity of the railways. The ordinary roads have been rendered impassable. On the branch lines of the Eastern Counties, from Ely to Peterborough and beyond, the arable and meadow lands are two and three feet under water for six and seven miles around, so that viewed from a train in transit, the country presents nothing but a vast sheet of water, from which neither the canals nor the rivers can be distinguished.
