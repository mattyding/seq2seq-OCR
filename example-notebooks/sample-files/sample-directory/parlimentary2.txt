	SIGNOR MARIETTI.
			The Earl of LIVERPOOL, before their lordships proceeded to thc business of thc day, wished to say a few words on a transaction which had been madc the subject of conversation previouisly to the adjournment. He alluded to what had passed respecting a letter written by M. Marietti, of Milan, to his son in this country, with reference to the alien bill. In consequence of what was stated in that letter, he had felt it to be his duty to write to Colonel Browne for an explanation of his conduct. Having received his answer, he would, with their lordships' permission, lay on the table the corre-spondence which had passed on the subject,and he was persuaded that the explanation would be found perfectly satisfactory. [A peer expressed a wish to hear the correspondence read] He had no objection to state the contents of the papers. [ Here the noble earl read several extracts, which were not distinctly heard throguhout.j The first,as we understood it, was a letter from Colonel Browne, in which he referrel to a conversation he had had with a clerk of M.Marietti : He had written a letter to M.Marietti,a copy of which (No. 1)  he enclosed with the original answer (No. 2). He trusted that, when these-papers were examined, he would be found fully acquitted of the charge which had been made against him. It had:been his wish to fulfil the instructions he had received but he 'hoped he should never act inconsistent with justice. [For these letters, see another part of our paper.]
			The Earl of LlVERPOOL, having laid theletters on the table; had not the slightest objection to their being printed, if such should ae the pleasure of the house. If any further doubt shouldl be entertained on this subject by any of their lordships, it would still be  open to inquiry. It was Colonel Browne's wish that it should be probed to the bottom, and he was therefore most desirous that the fullest explanaton should be given.
