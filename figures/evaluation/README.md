The following script checks the "recognizability" of the text pre and post-processing. Recognizability is defined in this context as the proportion of words that exist in our English lexicon. A "good" correction would be one where the proportion of recognizable text increases after processing.

The source of this text consists of London Times samples from 1820-1930. I am not including the actual data in this repo because of size and privacy considerations, but the times_recognizability.pkl file contains the counted proportions used to create these plots.
